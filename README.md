## Intention Timer

# A Project to Model Best Life and Programming Practices

  *Work on this project has slowed or stopped completely. Deadline 1/12/2021, 9pm MST.*

## Learning Goals

  * Gain understanding of how to write clean `HTML` and `CSS` to match the given comp
  * Put into practice writing clean, *DRY*, SRP `javaScript` functionality
  * Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using `localStorage` and `JSON`
  * Manipulate HTML with javaScript to better understand what it looks like to have a separate data model and the DOM Model
  * Build into and iterate over arrays in order to filter what is displayed in UI
  * Refactor, debug and review to fully understand each piece of style and function

## Overview

  *  This is a group student project to begin to understand the nuances of working on a team of people while increasing/solidifying code-skills.  We were tasked to build an application that allows the user to set goals for their health and productivity. We were tasked to tie those goals to a timer.

## Set-up
  * Create repository and clone to personal computer
  * Open in text editor
  * Read the README.md
  * In terminal, run command "open index.html" to interact with app.

## Functionality Goals

* At full functionality user's will select an activity category, set the amount of time they want to spend on that activity, and start the timer.  The app will log that activity to keep track of how the user has been spending their time.

## Road Map

* Future iterations should include expand/collapse reflection
* Functionality of favorite and re-do options with corresponding icons
* Pausing the timer
* Animate the timer
* Consider user experience and sit with the app and look for ways to make the experience more pleasurable and compassionate.
